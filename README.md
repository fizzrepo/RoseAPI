# RoseAPI
Basic spigot plugin for building your own API accessible to players.

This plugin is based on [RestPlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/Fredthedoggy/RestPlaceholderAPI) by Fredthedoggy and adds more functionality. Since the license in the original project requires me to keep the same license here, it is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0
