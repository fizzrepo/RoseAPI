# RoseAPI - Obsolete edition!
 > This is **completely discontinued** and is being replaced with my own stuff, so I don't have to deal with licensing.
 > Feel free to run it on your servers but you will not recieve support.
 
 **[The latest version can be found on BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/roseapi.23671/)** and will recieve the cool update this December!



Basic spigot plugin for building your own API accessible to players.

This plugin is based on [RestPlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/Fredthedoggy/RestPlaceholderAPI) by Fredthedoggy and adds more functionality. Since the license in the original project requires me to keep the same license here, it is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0
